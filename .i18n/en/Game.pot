msgid "Show that if $x = y$, then $f(x) = f(y)$."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.Functions.L01_functions
msgid "You can use the `subst` tactic to replace `y` with `x`. Typing either `subst h` or `subst y` will work."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.Functions.L01_functions
msgid "Now you can use `rfl` to finish the proof. Recall that `rfl` means that the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation are definitionally equal."

#: Game.Levels.Functions.L02_image
msgid "If $f \\colon X \\to Y$ and $A \\in X$, then the image of $A$ under $f$ is the set\n"
"$f(A) = \\{ f(x) \\mid x \\in A \\}$. In Lean, this is denoted `f '' A` or `image f A`.\n"
"\n"
"A hypothesis `y ∈ f '' A ` decomposes as a triple `⟨x, hxA, rfl⟩`, where `x` is an element of `A`, `hxA` is the proof that `x ∈ A`, and `rfl` is the proof that `f x = y`. This is a common pattern when working with images in Lean.\n"
"In this level, we will use the `rcases` tactic to decompose such hypotheses.\n"
"Whenever you have a hypothesis of the form `h : y ∈ f '' A`, you can write `rcase h with ⟨x, hxA, rfl⟩` to decompose it into its components.\n"
"To write the symbols `⟨` and `⟩`, you can write \\langle and \\rangle, respectively.\n"

"In this level, we prove the following property of images: If $A ⊆ B$, then $f(A) ⊆ f(B)$."

#: Game.Levels.Functions.L02_image

msgid "Well done!\n"
"If you don't want to use `rcases`, you can also apply the theorem `Set.mem_image`.\n"
"The command `rw [Set.mem_image] at h` will rewrite a hypothesis `h : y ∈ f '' A` into `∃ x ∈ A, f x = y`."
