World "Intersection"
Title "Intersection World"

Introduction
"If `A` and `B` are sets, then the *intersection* of `A` and `B`, denoted
`A ∩ B`, is the set of elements that the two sets have in common.  In other words,
for an object to be an element of `A ∩ B`, it must be an element of both `A` and `B`.

For example, if `A` is the set of all round things, and `B` is the set of all red things,
then `A ∩ B` is the set of all round red things.

In this world you'll prove some basic properties of intersections of sets.
